# hs0753_final-project

Plots or graphs for the report/slides are mainly made using the Final project code.ipynb. However, some modified versions exist for making specific plots, so not all codes are in the .ipynb file. If I need, I will submit all the codes, but they are not always organized, and basically the same as the submitted code.
